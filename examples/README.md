# BCH x402 examples

These examples are intentionally framework-neutral. They show the boundary
between x402 and the BCH wallet/provider/application that owns UTXOs, change,
signing, and broadcast.

## Check the examples

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run typecheck:examples
```

The examples do not contain mnemonics, private keys, network credentials, or
automatic broadcasts. Functions that need a wallet or provider accept one as
an argument.

## Integration rules shown by the examples

- BCH `value` is measured in satoshis.
- CashToken `amount` is the token quantity; `category` identifies the token.
- NFT state uses `capability` and `commitment`.
- Mainnet uses `bch:bitcoincash` and BIP44 coin type `145`.
- Chipnet uses `bch:bchtest` and BIP44 coin type `1`.
- Wallets select and reserve UTXOs, calculate fees, create change, sign, and
  broadcast. The x402 payload contains the resulting complete transaction.
- Facilitators obtain authoritative source outputs from their provider before
  validating or broadcasting a payment.
- CashScript compilation and covenant-specific successor rules remain the
  responsibility of the application that owns the contract.
